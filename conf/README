You can place local configuration settings files into this directory.

By default, the image server looks for a file called local_settings.py
but you can override this with the QIS_SETTINGS environment variable.
E.g. export QIS_SETTINGS=/opt/qis/conf/mysettings.py

These local settings are applied after the image server's base settings,
so you only need entries for those values that you want to override.

As a minimum you should override:

* SECRET_KEY - To generate a new secret key, you can use command:
               python -c 'import os; print repr(os.urandom(24))'

but other settings of note are:

* PUBLIC_HOST_NAME - Set this if your generated image URLs do not contain
                     the server's correct host name by default

* IMAGE_FORMAT_DEFAULT     - These determine the default image type returned
* IMAGE_QUALITY_DEFAULT      when there is no other instruction in place
* IMAGE_COLORSPACE_DEFAULT
* IMAGE_STRIP_DEFAULT

* MGMT_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE  - The appropriate number of database connections to
* CACHE_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE   reserve depends on your Apache settings
                             (i.e. worker and thread limits)
