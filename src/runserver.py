# Script to run the image server using the built-in development HTTP server.
# For a production deployment, use Apache with mod_wsgi and runserver.wsgi
#
# Usage: su username
#        python runserver.py [host [port]]
#
# Looks for conf/local_settings.py by default, or you can set the QIS_SETTINGS
# environment variable with the full path to your development settings file.
