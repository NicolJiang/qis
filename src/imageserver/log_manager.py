# =========  ====  ============================================================
# 03Aug2011  Matt  Changed to instantiate a logging server and log using a
#                  SocketHandler (making the logging multi-process safe)
# 31Aug2011  Matt  Renamed from logger.py to log_manager.py, converted into a
#                  class containing logging state to match stats_manager.py
# 04Jan2013  Matt  Move run_server to a static method, do not call from client constructor
