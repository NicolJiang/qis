    Alters an encoded image in any of the following ways, returning a newly encoded
    image: resize, rotate, crop, change format, change compression, sharpen or blur,
    adjust colour profile, change colour space, apply an overlay, strip metadata.

    image_data  - the raw image data (e.g. JPG bytes)
    data_type   - optional type (file extension) of the image data
    image_spec  - a key:value dictionary of imaging operations to perform

    The defined image_spec dictionary keys/values are as follows, though not
    all back-ends support all operations, and some may support extras. Use the
    imaging_supported_operations() function to query back-end support. Most of the
    keys are intentionally the same as those used for the image templates API,
    but there are differences for icc profile and overlay image, which are
    filenames in the templates but raw profile/image bytes here.

    page:          the page number to return (for multi-page images), default 1
    width:         the new image width, or 0 to keep proportional with a new height
    height:        the new image height, or 0 to keep proportional with a new width
    size_fit:      whether to adjust the requested width and height to retain the
                   image proportions and prevent padding, True or False
    align_h:       horizontal alignment if the image is to be padded, as the edge
                   to align (L, C, or R) and position 0 to 1, default "C0.5"
    align_v:       vertical alignment if the image is to be padded, as the edge
                   to align (T, C, or B) and position 0 to 1, default "C0.5"
    rotation:      number of degrees to rotate the image clockwise, default 0.0
    flip:          flip the image horizontally or vertically, "h" or "v", default ""
    sharpen:       sharpen or blur effect to apply, from -500 (heavy blur) to 500
                   (heavy sharpen), default 0 (none)
    dpi_x:         a new horizontal DPI value to assign to the image, default 0 (no change)
    dpi_y:         a new vertical DPI value to assign to the image, default 0 (no change)
    fill:          image background colour (when rotating or specifying both width
                   and height), format "blue", "#ffffff", "rgb(0,0,0)", or special
                   values "auto" or "transparent", default white
    top:           top cropping value, 0 to 1, default 0.0 (none)
    left:          left cropping value, 0 to 1, default 0.0 (none)
    bottom:        bottom cropping value, 0 to 1, default 1.0 (none)
    right:         right cropping value, 0 to 1, default 1.0 (none)
    crop_fit:      whether to adjust cropping positions to reduce padding when both
                   width and height are specified, True or False
    overlay_data:  raw image bytes to overlay as a watermark, default None
    overlay_size:  size of the overlay relative to the base image, 0 to 1, default 1.0
    overlay_pos:   position of the overlay on the main image:
                   "N", "NE", "E","SE", "S", "SW", "W", "NW", default "C" for centre.
    overlay_opacity: opacity level of the overlay, 0 to 1, default 1.0 (opaque)
    icc_data:      raw bytes of an ICC profile to apply to the image, default None
    icc_intent:    how to apply the ICC profile: "saturation", "perceptual",
                   "absolute", or "relative", default ""
    icc_bpc:       whether to use black point compensation when applying an ICC
                   profile with the relative rendering intent, True or False
    tile:          tuple of (tile number, grid size) to produce an image tile
                   following all other adjustments, default (0, 0)
    colorspace:    changes the colour model of an image: "rgb", "gray", or "cmyk",
                   default "" (no change)
    format:        lower case image format to return, default "jpg"
    quality:       JPG quality or PNG compression type, 0 to 100, default 80
    resize_type:   resizing algorithm, 1 (fastest) to 3 (best quality), default 3
    strip:         whether to strip EXIF data and colour profiles from the image,
                   True or False, default False

    Specifying both width and height of 0 will retain the original image size.

    If the requested new width/height or cropping values define a different aspect
    ratio, and auto_size_fit is false, the image will be returned at the requested
    size, with the original image centred within it, surrounded by the fill colour.
    If auto_size_fit is true, either the width or height will be reduced so that
    there is no fill (and so then the requested size is not respected).

    When cropping the image and a target width and a height have been specified,
    the optional auto_crop_fit flag can be enabled. This will attempt to minimise
    the amount of fill colour (padding) in the final image by enlarging the
    requested crop rectangle to best fill the target. Padding will not necessarily
    be eliminated unless the auto_size_fit flag is also used.

    If a tile of the image is requested, tile number must be between 1 and
    the grid size inclusive. The grid size must be a square (4, 9, 16, etc),
    minimum size 4. Tile number 1 is top left in the grid, and the last tile is
    bottom right. The tile is generated last, after all other adjustments.

    Returns a new image, encoded in the format requested by the image_spec.

    Raises a ValueError if the supplied data is not a supported image, or for
    invalid parameter values. Other back-end specific errors may also be raised.
