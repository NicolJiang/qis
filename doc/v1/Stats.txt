QIS v1.19 Stats revamp
======================

System stats and image stats counter fields made consistent:

requests = total number of image requests regardless of response and stats param
views = total number of images returned
cached_views = total number of images returned from server cache
downloads = total number of originals served
total_bytes = total size of image data responses (not including HTTP headers)
request_seconds = total time taken generating responses

We now have 5 types of image response:

HTTP 200 generated image - increment requests + views + total_bytes + request_seconds
HTTP 200 image returned from cache - increment requests + views + cached_views + total_bytes + request_seconds
HTTP 304 not modified - increment requests + request_seconds

HTTP 200 download original - increment requests + downloads + total_bytes + request_seconds
HTTP 304 original not modified - increment requests + request_seconds

When the stats=0 image parameter is present:

System stats will be updated as usual.
Image stats will increment the total requests field only.
