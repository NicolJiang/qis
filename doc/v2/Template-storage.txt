QIS v2.0 Move image templates from text files into the database
===============================================================

Add Template model class
- name (lower case, unique index)
- displayname (user's own case)
- description
- template (json)
- last changed date? by who?

[With a displayname for templates, we could do with the same for ICC profiles,
 which are currently all lower case in the UI, not ideal]

Storing template data as JSON means we can add/remove image fields without breaking
existing templates. We'll lose the comments in the template files so ensure the
comments are documented in the help file.

[We have a description field for the template, but would users like (to retain)
 the ability to store per-field comments in the template?]

Add a template manager to list/get/set/delete templates. Validation function too.
Template manager to call data manager and cache templates internally.
Template manager cache to be invalidated when a template is updated/deleted.
Add templates to data API, API to call template manager.
API to handle validation failures on add/update.

Existing image publish page does most of what we need for defining a template.
Having a preview is nice for some fields.
Tweaks required, e.g. hiding the template field, html output.
May be best to have a new admin page but refactor+re-use common components.
