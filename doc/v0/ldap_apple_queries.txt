to get a list of users,
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" "(objectClass=apple-user)" dn uidNumber apple-generateduid gidNumber uid cn givenName sn

to authenticate a user,
first find their dn,
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" "(&(objectClass=apple-user)(uid=dhruv))" dn
then try and bind with that dn and the supplied password password0
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" -D "uid=dhruv,cn=users,dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" -w password0 "(&(objectClass=apple-user)(uid=dhruv))" dn uidNumber apple-generateduid gidNumber uid cn givenName sn

to authorize a user as a member of a group,
first authenticate them while finding out their primary group,
check for this gidNumber among the groups,
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" "(&(objectClass=apple-group)(gidNumber=20))" dn apple-generateduid
if this result is not positive, check the supplementary group memberships,
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" "(&(objectClass=apple-group)(apple-group-memberguid=22353A20-FC0C-4514-AFE9-B638DFBAB109))" dn

to authorize a user as a part of an organizational unit,
authenticate them while including their OU branch,
$ ldapsearch -x -h gate.quru.com -b "cn=users,dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" -D "uid=dhruv,cn=users,dc=gate,dc=quru,dc=com" -w password0 "(&(objectClass=apple-user)(uid=dhruv))" dn uidNumber apple-generateduid gidNumber uid cn givenName sn
