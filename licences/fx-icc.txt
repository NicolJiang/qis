CX RGB RenderTest PCS=RGB.icc
---
The "PCS" in the file name stands for Perceptual, Colorimetric and Saturation. If you use the Perceptual rendering intent during printing, the image will have a strong red cast. If you use Relative Colorimetric, the image will go green, and Saturation will look blue. P = R; C = G; S = B.


CX_Monitor_weird.icc
---
This monitor profile gives a strange look, while still rendering your display readable.


CX Hue+45 abst.icc
---
This is an abstract profile that simply adds 45 degrees to the hue of all colors. In other words, all the colors in the image take a short spin around the color wheel.
